# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to create a map of customer travel destinations based off preferred min and max temparatures and create a travel itinerary. To do this we retrieved weather data using APIs.

## Results: 

### Deliverable 1 

We generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieved the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. We retrieved the following pieces of information:

Latitude and longitude
Maximum temperature
Percent humidity
Percent cloudiness
Wind speed
Weather description (for example, clouds, fog, light rain, clear sky)


### Deliverable 2
We created input statement to retrieve customer weather preferences and then used the csv file we created in Deliverable 1 to retrieve possible cities to travel to and hotels in those cities.

### Deliverable 3
Using the csv we generated from deliverable 2 we created an itinerary, in Japan, of 4 cities that would be a good fit based off customer weather preferences
